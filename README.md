# Challenge-Card Game

Card game is the first project/challenge that we had been assigned as trainees at BeCode, Ghent. The project is a simple Object oriented code that allows you to distribute a hand to any number of players from a standard deck and allows them to play each card upon their turn. The game finishes when all the cards from each players hands are played and there are no more cards to play. 
Ofcourse there is a logical player limit of 52 on this game

You will be asked to enter the number of players and then the name of each of the players. This is so that it is easy to keep track of who got what and how many cards.

## Installation

You don't really need anyhting! Just fork the repository to get the code and try it out for yourself!
```

## Usage

You will be prompted with instructions to follow the program and play the game. Just make sure not to deviate too much from the prompted instructions as the game is still in its infancy stages and probably will need some tiome before it becomes a lot more intuitive.


## Contributing
You are welcome to append and make changes to the source code with intentions of making it a better game or so it suits your needs. Please do send me a copy before you make changes though!
